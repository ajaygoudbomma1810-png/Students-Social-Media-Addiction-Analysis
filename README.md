##  Project Overview

This project provides insights into:

- Average daily usage of social media  
- Addiction score calculation  
- Impact of social media on:
  - Sleep  
  - Productivity  
  - Academic performance  
  - Stress/Anxiety levels  
- Platform-wise addiction (Instagram, Snapchat, YouTube, etc.)

The cleaned dataset is exported via Python and imported into Power BI for creating an interactive dashboard.

##  Data Cleaning Steps (Python)

The pipeline includes:

- Handling missing values  
- Fixing inconsistent data  
- Converting data types  
- Creating new features (e.g., **Addiction_Score**)  
- Encoding categorical variables  
- Exporting a clean, ready-to-use CSV for Power BI

## 📊 Power BI Dashboard

The dashboard includes:

- **Addiction Level Distribution**  
- **Time Spent on Social Media**  
- **Sleep vs Usage Correlation**  
- **Academic Score vs Addiction**  
- **Gender & Age segmentation**  
- Filters for deep exploratory analysis  

---

##  Key Insights

- Students using social media for **4+ hours/day** showed reduced sleep duration  
- High addiction levels correlate with **lower academic performance**  
- Instagram & Snapchat users displayed **higher anxiety indicators**  
- Teenagers (16–21) showed the **highest addiction scores**
